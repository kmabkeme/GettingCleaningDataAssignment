# GettingCleaningDataAssignment
Final project for Data Science Course 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data

In this folder you will find a script called run_analysis.R that is meant to be used with the data set Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.

The files in this set include:

run_analysis.R - script for processing the data in the Human Activity Recognition Data set. This file needs to be placed into the folder where the zip file containing the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is located and then loaded with “source()”. If you use RStudio, opening run_analysis.R in R Studio and then checking “Source on Save” and saving the file will cause the script to run.

CodeBook.md - Describes the data that is in the the resulting output text file

TidyAveragedAvgAndStdDevBySubjectAndActivity.txt - The resulting text file from when the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set is processed using run_analysis.R
